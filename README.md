# Bollywood-Stereotyping

The project's goal is to analyze and quantify gender-based stereotypes by studying the demarcation of roles designated to males and females and propose a machine learning solution to identify all occurrences of gender stereotypes in scripts, trailers  & in wikipedia-data and to categorize them appropriately. 

Eg., Let us look into the plot of a blockbuster movie. Rohit is an aspiring singer who works as a salesman in a car showroom, run by Malik (Dalip Tahil). One day he meets Sonia Saxena (Ameesha Patel), daughter of Mr. Saxena (Anupam Kher), when he goes to deliver a car to her home as her birthday present.” This piece of text is taken from the plot of Bollywood movie Kaho Na Pyaar Hai. 
This simple two line plot showcases the issue in following fashion: 1. Male (Rohit) is portrayed with a profession & an aspiration 2. Male (Malik) is a business owner. In contrast, the female role is introduced with no profession or aspiration.The introduction, itself, is dependent upon another male character ”daughter of”!
